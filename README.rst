What is NSKinetics?
-------------------

NSKinetics is a fast, flexible, and convenient package to simulate non-steady state reaction kinetics, especially for systems involving enzymatic conversions. Models for multiple inhibitory phenomena (competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, and "mechanism-based") are also included.

Installation
------------

Get the latest version of NSKinetics from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/nskinetics/>`__. If you have an installation of Python with pip, simply install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install nskinetics

To get the git version, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git://github.com/sarangbhagwat/nskinetics

For help on common installation issues, please visit the `documentation <https://nskinetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

Documentation
-------------

NSKinetic's `full documentation <https://nskinetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is currently being developed. In the meantime, here are some examples to get started:

**Example 1: Simple enzyme-substrate system**

.. code-block:: python

    import nskinetics as nsk

    # Create a SpeciesSystem object
    sp_sys = nsk.SpeciesSystem('sp_sys', 
                           ['E', 'S', 'ES', 'P'], # enzyme, substrate, enzyme-substrate complex, product
                           concentrations=[1e-4, 1e-4, 0, 0])

    # Describe reactions by writing chemical equations and kinetic parameter info
    reactions = [
                'E + S <-> ES; kf = 12, kb = 10.0', # kf = kon, kb = koff
                'ES -> E + P; kf = 32.0' # kf = kcat (enzyme turnover number)
                ]

    # Generate a ReactionSystem from strings
    rxn_sys = nsk.ReactionSystem(ID='ESP_rxn_sys', 
                                 reactions=reactions,
                                 species_system=sp_sys)

    # Simulate the ReactionSystem
    rxn_sys.solve(t_span=[0, 2*24*3600], # I want to simulate the system over 2 days
                 sp_conc_for_events={'S':1e-6}, # In addition to a full simulation,
                 )                              # I want to know the time at which [S] drops to 1e-6

    # Plot results
    rxn_sys.plot_solution()

Since [ES] was too small to view in the overall plot, let's also plot it separately:

.. code-block:: python

    rxn_sys.plot_solution(sps_to_include=['ES'])

**Example 2: Simple enzyme-substrate system + competitive inhibition + "mechanism-based" inhibition**

.. code-block:: python

    import nskinetics as nsk
    
    # Create a SpeciesSystem object
    sp_sys = nsk.SpeciesSystem('sp_sys', 
                           ['E', 'S', 'ES', 'P',
                            'I_CI', 'EI_CI', 'Q',
                            'I_MBI', 'EI_MBI_unstable', 'EI_MBI_stable'], # mechanism-based_inhibitor, unstable enzyme-MBI complex, stable enzyme-MBI complex 
                           concentrations=[1e-4, 1e-4, 0, 0,
                                           5e-5, 0, 0,
                                           3e-5, 0, 0])
    
    # Describe reactions by writing chemical equations and kinetic parameter info
    reactions = [
                'E + S <-> ES; kf = 12, kb = 10.0',
                'ES -> E + P; kf = 32.0',
                'E + I_CI <-> EI_CI; kf=12, kb=10.0',
                'EI_CI -> E + Q; kf=32',
                'E + I_MBI <-> EI_MBI_unstable; kf=12.0, kb=10',
                'EI_MBI_unstable -> EI_MBI_stable; kf = 32'
                ]
    
    # Generate a ReactionSystem from strings
    rxn_sys = nsk.ReactionSystem(ID='rxn_sys', 
                                     reactions=reactions,
                                     species_system=sp_sys)
    
    # Simulate the ReactionSystem
    rxn_sys.solve(t_span=[0, 2*24*3600],
                  sp_conc_for_events={'S':1e-6})
    
    # Plot results
    rxn_sys.plot_solution()

**Example 3: Simple enzyme-substrate system in a fed-batch regime**

.. code-block:: python

    import nskinetics as nsk
    
    # Create a SpeciesSystem object
    sp_sys = nsk.SpeciesSystem('sp_sys', 
                           ['E', 'S', 'ES', 'P',],
                           concentrations=[1e-4, 1e-4, 0, 0,])
    
    # Describe reactions by writing chemical equations and kinetic parameter info
    reactions = [
                'E + S <-> ES; kf = 12, kb = 10.0',
                'ES -> E + P; kf = 32.0',
                ]
    
    # Generate a ReactionSystem from strings
    rxn_sys = nsk.ReactionSystem(ID='rxn_sys', 
                                     reactions=reactions,
                                     species_system=sp_sys)
    
    
    # Describe forced concentration spikes for any species 
    # (e.g., from feeding substrate in a fed-batch regime)
    spikes = {20000: 'Target; S; 1e-4', # at t=40000, add enough S to achieve [S]=1e-4
              50000: 'Target; S; 1e-4', # at t=50000, add enough S to to achieve [S]=1e-4
              80000: 'Target; S; 1e-4', # at t=80000, add enough S to achieve [S]=1e-4
              100000: 'Change; S; 2e-4',# at t=100000, add enough S to increase [S] by 2e-4
              }
    
    # Simulate the ReactionSystem
    rxn_sys.solve(t_span=[0, 2*24*3600],
                  sp_conc_for_events={'S':1e-6},
                  spikes=spikes)
    
    # Plot results
    rxn_sys.plot_solution()
