What is NSKinetics?
-------------------

NSKinetics is a fast, flexible, and convenient package to simulate non-steady state reaction kinetics, especially for systems involving enzymatic conversions. Models for multiple inhibitory phenomena (competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, and "mechanism-based") are also included.
