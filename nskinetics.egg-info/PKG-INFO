What is NSKinetics?
-------------------

NSKinetics is a fast, flexible, and convenient package to simulate non-steady state reaction kinetics, especially for systems involving enzymatic conversions. Models for multiple inhibitory phenomena (competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, and "mechanism-based") are also included.

Installation
------------

Get the latest version of NSKinetics from `PyPI <link to be added>`__. If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

    $ pip install nskinetics

To get the git version, run:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sarangbhagwat/nskinetics

For help on common installation issues, please visit the `documentation <link to be added>`__.
