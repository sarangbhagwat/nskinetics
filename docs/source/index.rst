NSKinetics: Non-Steady State Kinetics Simulation
================================================

**NSKinetics** is a fast, flexible, and convenient package to simulate non-steady state reaction kinetics, especially for systems involving enzymatic conversions. Models for multiple inhibitory phenomena (competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, and "mechanism-based") are also included.


Installation
------------

Get the latest version of NSKinetics from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/nskinetics/>`__. If you have an installation of Python with pip, simply install it with:

    $ pip install nskinetics

To get the git version, run:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sarangbhagwat/nskinetics

For help on common installation issues, please visit the `documentation <link to be added>`__.


.. note::

   Autosummary-generated `API <https://nskinetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/nskinetics.html#module-nskinetics>`__ is available. Full documentation is expected soon.
