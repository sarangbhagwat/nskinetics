NSKinetics: Non-Steady State Kinetics Simulation
================================================

**NSKinetics** is a fast, flexible, and convenient package to simulate non-steady state reaction kinetics, especially for systems involving enzymatic conversions. Models for multiple inhibitory phenomena (competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, and "mechanism-based") are also included.


.. note::

   Autosummary-based API is available. Full documentation is expected soon.
